### How to Write Commit Messages

- Start the commit message with the type, followed by a colon and a space (e.g., `feat: Add new feature`).
- Provide a concise and descriptive commit message.
- If the commit addresses an issue, include the issue number in the message (e.g., `fix: Resolve #123`).

### Example Commit Messages
