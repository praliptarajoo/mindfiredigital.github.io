    description: `Cookies serve several essential purposes for our website. First,
            they enhance security by identifying and mitigating potential
            threats, thus ensuring a safer user experience. Additionally,
            cookies optimize the website's performance by efficiently
            routing traffic between servers and adapting to individual
            preferences, resulting in faster loading times and a personalized
            feel. Furthermore, they enable seamless integration with third-party
            services, like GitHub, enhancing functionality and enriching the
            user experience. Finally, cookies gather valuable data through tools
            such as Google Analytics, providing insights into user behavior and
            preferences, which we use to continually improve and tailor our
            website to your needs.`,

            process for doing this can vary depending on your specific web
            browser, and instructions are typically available in the
            browser's "help" section. Please be aware that if you
